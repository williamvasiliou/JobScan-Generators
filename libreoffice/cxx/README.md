# libreoffice/cxx

Document generation templates that require LibreOffice.

## `Main.cxx`

File is generated by `template.mjs` using the `config.json` in this directory. Alternatively, this file may be edited manually. Search for code comments.

## `template.mjs`

Required by the build script to generate the files `Main.cxx`, `ResumeCommand.tsx`, `compile.js`, and `serve.js`. Generation behavior may be customized by editing `config.json`.

## `config.json`

Edit the following keys to control the generation behavior of `template.mjs`:

### `port`

Type: Number

The port for the UNO connection.

### `IN`

Type: String

Default: `"resume.odt"`

Path to the infile.

### `OUT`

Type: String

Default: `"resume.pdf"`

Path to the outfile.

### `length`

Type: Number

Length of each chunk read from the outfile to be written to standard output.

### `timeout`

Type: Number

Timeout in milliseconds. If the timeout is 0, then the thread will not be interrupted.

### `starts`

Type: Array

Default: `[]`

Array of processes started after the outfile is created. Each process is represented by an array of strings. In such an array, the first string is the command. The remainder of the strings are passed as arguments to the process.
